### PROJECT TITLE: "OptiDrive: Streamlining Edmonton's Food Drive with Interactive Maps and Donation Insights"
Welcome to my personal project.
### Problem Statement

"Inefficient Coordination and Visibility: The current Edmonton food drive lacks a centralized system for stake distribution, ward assignments, and drop-off locations, leading to logistical challenges. 
### Solution

There is a critical need for a solution that optimizes the process by integrating Streamlit App with an embedded Google Map, providing real-time insights into stake positions, ward allocations, and donation bag drop-off locations to enhance coordination and streamline the food drive operations."
